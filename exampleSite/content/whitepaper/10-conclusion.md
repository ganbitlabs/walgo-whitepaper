## Summary

Walgo bridges the gap between markdown-based content creation and decentralized web publishing. By wrapping the complexity of Hugo, Walrus, and the Sui blockchain into a single CLI, it makes permanent, censorship-resistant web hosting accessible to everyone — from developers deploying documentation to writers publishing their first blog.

The key contributions of this project are:

- **Unified pipeline** — A single tool handles site generation, optimization, compression, and deployment, eliminating the need to manage multiple binaries and configurations
- **Dual deployment modes** — HTTP deployment for frictionless testing and on-chain deployment for permanent publishing, each optimized for its use case
- **AI content generation** — A resumable pipeline that creates complete, theme-appropriate websites from natural language descriptions
- **Project management** — Persistent tracking of deployments with easy updates, removing the burden of manual object ID management
- **Built-in themes** — Purpose-built themes for biolink pages and whitepapers, optimized for minimal Walrus storage footprint
- **Desktop application** — A graphical interface that brings all CLI functionality to users who prefer visual tools

## Vision

We envision a web where content permanence is the default, not the exception. Where a researcher's paper, an artist's portfolio, or a community's documentation persists because the network guarantees it — not because a company chooses to keep the servers running.

Walgo is building toward that vision incrementally. Each release makes decentralized publishing slightly easier, slightly faster, and slightly more accessible. The end goal is a tool where the user thinks about their content, not about the infrastructure beneath it.

## Open Source

Walgo is fully open source under the MIT license. The entire codebase — CLI, desktop app, themes, and documentation — is available on GitHub:

- **Repository:** [github.com/selimozten/walgo](https://github.com/selimozten/walgo)
- **License:** MIT
- **Contributions:** Pull requests, bug reports, and feature suggestions are welcome

We believe that tools for the decentralized web should themselves be transparent and community-driven.

## Acknowledgments

Walgo was selected as a Walrus RFP winner for developer tooling, receiving support from the Walrus ecosystem to advance decentralized web publishing.

Special thanks to:

- **Mysten Labs** — For building Sui and Walrus, the infrastructure that makes decentralized web hosting practical
- **The Hugo community** — For creating the fastest static site generator and maintaining an excellent ecosystem of themes and tools
- **Contributors** — For bug reports, feature suggestions, and code contributions that improve Walgo with every release
